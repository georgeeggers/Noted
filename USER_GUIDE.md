## Main Menu
### Main UI
Upon loading Noted for the first time, you should be met with this screen.

### Search Bar
The search bar serves a dual purpose. It's used both to search for old boards by their name, and to create new boards.

### Preexisting Boards

Prexisting boards will be displayed underneath the search bar. You can use the search bar to search for boards by their display name. Clicking a board will load you into the board UI.

## Board UI

### New Boards

Upon loading into a board, or creating a new one, you will be met with this UI.

### Control Bar

You may notice the primary control bar at the bottom of the window. The four buttons on the left will spawn different nodes in the main board. From left to right, they will spawn a Text Node, ToDo Node, Image Node, and File Node. The button on the right of the divider will sort the nodes, but we'll go over that a little bit later.

### Spawning Nodes

Clicking one of these 4 buttons will spawn a towards the center of the screen. Each node consists of a title, some sort of content, and the control bar at the bottom.

### Node Controls

You may notice the pen icon on the bottom of each node is highlighted green. This means that the node is in editing mode. The content of nodes cannot be changed when they are not in editing mode. From left to right, the buttons on the control bar will toggle editing mode, delete the node, or do some sort of special action. The icon of 6 dots act as a handle. Left clicking and dragging on the handle will let you move each note anywhere in the board. Similarly, right clicking and dragging anywhere on the board will move the actual camera.

### Exiting

To return to the main menu, press the board name in the top right of the screen. However, if you have unsaved changes, a dot will appear.

### Saving

Attempting to return to the main menu with unsaved changed will display an alert. This is a completely valid way to save, but you can also press Control + S to save at any time.
